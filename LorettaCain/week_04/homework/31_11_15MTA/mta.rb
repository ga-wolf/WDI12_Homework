# Activity:

# Students should create a program that models a simple subway system.

# The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the total number of stops for the trip.

# There are 3 subway lines:
# The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
# The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
# The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
# All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points.
# For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.
# Hints:

# Don't worry about user input initially: get it working with hardcoded values first, and wire up the user interface once that's working
# Consider diagraming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
# Make subway lines keys in a hash, while the values are an array of all the stops on each line.
# The key to the lab is to find the intersection of the lines at Union Square.
# Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)

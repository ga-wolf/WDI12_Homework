Ocean.create :name => 'Arctic Ocean', :location => "Sometimes considered a sea or estuary of the Atlantic, which covers much of the Arctic and washes upon northern North America and Eurasia", :deepest_point => 5450, :average_depth => 1038, :fact => "The Arctic Ocean (also known as the Northern Ocean), located in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Arctic north polar region, is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceanic divisions. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean."
Ocean.create :name => 'Pacific Ocean', :location => "Separates Asia and Oceania from the Americas", :deepest_point => 11033, :average_depth => 4188, :fact => "The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. At 165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles) in area, this largest division of the World Ocean—and, in turn, the hydrosphere—covers about 46% of the Earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area, making it larger than all of the Earth's land area combined."
Ocean.create :name => 'Atlantic Ocean',  :location => "Separates the Americas from Eurasia and Africa", :deepest_point => 8648, :average_depth => 3872, :fact => "The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceanic divisions, following the Pacific Ocean. With a total area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi), it covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. The first part of its name refers to Atlas of Greek mythology, making the Atlantic the 'Sea of Atlas'."
Ocean.create :name => 'Indian Ocean',  :location => "Washes upon southern Asia and separates Africa and Australia", :deepest_point => 7725, :average_depth => 3872, :fact => "The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface. It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after India. The Indian Ocean is known as Ratnakara, 'the mine of gems', in ancient Sanskrit literature and as Hind Mahasagar in Hindi and other Indian languages."
Ocean.create :name => 'Southern Ocean',  :location => "Sometimes considered an extension of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which encircles Antarctica", :deepest_point => 7235, :average_depth => 3900, :fact => "The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters."

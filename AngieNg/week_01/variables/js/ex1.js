The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var noOfChild = 2 ;
var partnerName = 'Alex';
var geoLocation = 'Sydney';
var jobTitle = 'Web Developer';

var fortune = "You will be a " +jobTitle+ " in " + geoLocation + ", and married to " +partnerName+ " with " + noOfChild + " kids.";

console.log(fortune);
